# ðŸ“‰ Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting B2B customer churn using machine learning, hyperparameter optimization, and feature engineering to drive proactive retention strategies.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

Customer churn is a costly problemâ€”especially in B2B industries where client acquisition costs are high. In this project, I used a dataset from a telecom provider to build a predictive churn model using LightGBM. The model achieved:

- **âœ… Accuracy**: 84.4%
- **ðŸŽ¯ AUC-ROC**: 0.93

With this model, Telco can now:
- Identify high-risk customers
- Launch targeted retention campaigns
- Reduce churn and protect recurring revenue
